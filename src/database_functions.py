"""This fill contains all functions related to the database

In this version There are 3 relevant functions for the software
export_types_json() :
this function allows to update the existing types of ships in config.json
and thus allowed the software to work properly (given that the user has
selected the types he wanted for the search)
update_wanted_info() :
this function allows to update the column names from the database in the config
file. By default the new names are set to 0, which means the user must select
them by setting them to 1 manually to change the ouput of the next function
find_info_per_bateau() :
This function search for all the ships which correspond to one of the type
specified in config.json. It also extracts all their information from the
database as specified in config.json.

2 libraries are used :
- xlrd, to read the database which is a .xlsx file (Excel),
- json, for all treatments of config.json.
See the respective documentations if necessary.

There are 3 unused functions at the end of the file. They can be used to look
for the type of ships.
Use search_mmsi(message) to add the type of the ship to message
Use mmsi_in_database(mmsi) to get the type of a ship given its mmsi
Use find_name_of_ships to get the ship type corresponding to a list of mmsi
The last one can be used in conjonction with type 5 AIS message to verify if
the given names are correct.

>>> The following assumptions are made for the database <<<
it's a .xlsx file with one sheet
the first colonn contains the mmsi
the third one, the names
the fifth one, the types
If it's modified in the database, modifify the global variables in accordance
with those changes.
